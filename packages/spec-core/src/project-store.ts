// more than on POSIX: the separator is `\\`, and an absolute path opens with a drive letter whose COLON is
// illegal in a filename. Leaving it in produced `…/projects/C:-Users-…`, and the mkdir for it failed — which
// took out `spex spec lint` and `spex graph --public --html` on every Windows machine. `:` and `\\` never
// occur in a POSIX absolute path, so an existing Linux or macOS store keeps the exact name it already has.
